# systemcheck uses the xbp interface for several tasks (scheduling reports, downloading spools, and so on.
# to use the xbp interface, you need to specify the 4 options below
# xbp_ext_company is an arbitraty company name. mainly the company that developed the softare that
#    uses the interface to perform its activities
# xbp_ext_product contains the name of the product that attempts to connect
# xbp_ext_user is not a username in the abap system. it's a simple string that can contain anything
# several versions of the xpb interface exist with different apis. we will be using version 3.0
# dont change the version since this may break things.

#   lower : convert the username to lower case
#   ignore: don't do anything with the username
